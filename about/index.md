**Welcome to the Official Google Developer Group (New York City)** 

We are a technology-based organization that is completely run by a community of volunteer organizers. Because of this we are always looking for volunteer help in running events, and are open to community suggestions and contributions in terms of speakers, event venues and sponsorships. Just talk to one of the organizers and we'll be happy to work with you. 

We typically meet on the first or second Monday of each month for our regular meetups. In addition, we may have "special" events (e.g., ML Camp, Study Jam etc.) scheduled outside of these dates, at a different interval. 


## About GDG NYC

We are software developers, designers, educators and students with an interest in learning about emergent technologies in areas including (but not limited to) mobile, web, wearables, cloud computing, education technology, data sciences and smart homes. 

Our events can vary from featured Tech Talks (40 mins or more) to Short Talks (20 mins), Lightning Talks (5 mins) as well as focused events (workshops, hackathons, study jams). 

Our talks may feature Google technology (e.g., Chrome, Android, AngularJS, Google Glass, Android Wear, Polymer, Google Compute Engine ..) but also extends to competitive technologies, products and platforms. 

_Our primary goal is to create actionable networking, collaboration and entrepreneurial connections for technology enthusiasts in the New York City._

## History 

The founding organizers of this meetup are long-time members of the Google Developer Group community. Prior to March 2016, this meetup existed as "GDG New York" and we organized several successful events around Android, Cloud, Polymer, VR, Wearables and Chrome under that banner.  

In March 2016, we made a collective decision to rebrand and launch "GDG NYC" as the official Google Developer Group New York City chapter and look forward to working with both the Google Developer advocates and with the greater New York City developer community, to make this city a showcase for next-generation technologies. Join us! 



## Disclosure

We are not run by Google. However, we are a listed Google Developers community and count on them as one of our sponsors (specifically as venue hosts and for signature events like Study Jams). Any opinions and activities here are our own and do not reflect that of Google (the corporation).
